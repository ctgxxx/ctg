Taobao Body (Female)
Chinese body that requires the use of a proxy to buy, /ctg/ recommends 42agent paste the Taobao link into the 42agent link in the appropriate spot to proceed. 42agent makes the 1st purchase from the Taobao site and charges you the first payment then a second payment will be to ship the body to you
** update it looks like now in order for this to work you have to do this on your phone. Otherwise, it looks like the process is the same.

Sozai Bodies
The Sozai bodies are great for customizers, they don’t feature the anatomical correctness of the Hon studio or Taobao bodies but the trade off is that they come in a variety of flesh tones which should match a head that’s a different color than the standard flash color figma and figuarts usually uses. If you are in search of a male body this is at the moment your only option.

Second Axe Hentai Action Figures
Shizue Minase, Erika Kuramoto, Asagi Igawa (regular and metallic), and Sakura Igawa
> https://native-store.net/en/CATEGORY-ROOT/Second-Axe/c/206?site=NATIVE_EN&lang=en&sessionId=3EE10EC6110E901C49CDB30494A2D0EC.node45 
The quintessential coomer figures, they are hard to find, and if you do find one be prepared to pay. Shizue Minase has a popular bootleg version that is easy to find on eBay and Aliexpress. The likely hood of other figures getting a KO treatment is yet to be seen but strongly hoped for. Asagi Iwagawa is currently in the wild but the late coomer tax is high, expect to pay upwards of $400+

An older line of figures that still holds up IMO, unfortunately will really only be able to find them opened or used. Prices can range from relatively cheap (Ymir,Nanael,Airi) to expensive (Branwen,Annelotte,Aldora)

An original line of figures that appeals to the coomer sensibilities with an expanding range of figures. Older figures can have QC issues while recent ones are much improved. Iana (Lana) Kalashnikov is a particular favorite since she is a thicc busty figure.

S.H.Figuarts Street Fighter V Rainbow Mika
>https://myfigurecollection.net/item/600429

A new figure by the renamed studio that are makers of the Hon studio bodies. This adorable figure is reminiscent of a studio Ghibli character. Except you can take her clothes off and she’s 100% anatomical.

Snail Shell Wolf Girl
> https://www.amiami.com/eng/detail/?gcode=FIGURE-611278
The OG snail shell figure that kicked off the line. Project Wolf Wolf girl comes in several varieties including swimsuit and pale black bikini/armor versions. The swimsuit version has traditional wolf ears versus the armored wolf ears of the armored versions along with non-armored legs that makes her the most favorite version.

KO Anatomical dog from Butterfly’s Dream Choco Figure Vol.2 
>Find on eBay or aliexpress using “butterfly dream figure” 
Not a bully per se but I wasn’t sure where to put it. What can I say it’s an Knock off articulated dog with a “red rocket”, you already know if you want this or not by that description. Oh yeah it comes with a lewd statue and a grass floor mat.
>KO Keywords: Butterfly dream

Hasbro Power Rangers Lightning Collection Mighty Morphin Pudgy Pig
>https://www.target.com/p/power-rangers-lightning-collection-mighty-morphin-pudgy-pig/-/A-83838019
A figure that is capable of opening his mouth to an extremely wide angle. This figure can fit 1/12 figures into his mouth at least halfway. A great figure for those that have a vore fetish or just want a neat pig that can swallow figures.
