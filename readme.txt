Hon Studio Bodies (aka Manatee Industry) (Female):
This is the same or similar body used for manatee industry figures, other figures also use this buck. These female bucks are compatible with almost all figma heads or any head that has a pegged neck joint. These are anatomically correct and come with several hands.
>https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B07W1CFP4M/ 

Taobao Body (Female) (needs Chinese proxy):
Female buck body that has large breasts. This body is very similar to figma super sonico’s body without the swimsuit. The breast on this buck is larger than the Hon buck however the quality is not as good. Still recommended for those who want a larger bust than a hon body provides.
>https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=659231514481 

Sozai Bodies
The Sozai bodies are great for customizers, they don’t feature the anatomical correctness of the Hon studio or Taobao bodies, but the tradeoff is that they come in a variety of flesh tones which should match a head that’s a different color than the standard flash color figma and figuarts usually uses. If you are in search of a male body this is at the moment your only option.

Genuine Second Axe Hentai Action Figures:
Shizue Minase, Erika Kuramoto, Yukikaze Mizuki, Asagi Igawa (regular and metallic), and Sakura Igawa
The top-of-the-line modern coomer figures, they are made to order at specific periods, often with bonus naughty parts. Once the made to order period is over, they can be found in the aftermarket, often for exorbitant markup. However due to the current market they are not as expensive as the once were.
*Note: these are expensive figures, if you see them for sub $100 USD they are boot legs!

Bootleg Second Axe Hentai Action Figures:
Shizue Minase, Erika Kuramoto, Asagi Igawa (regular), and Sakura Igawa (not figure accurate currently)
For those who do not wish to pay the high cost of genuine second axe figures there are bootleg versions. These lower quality versions often come with subpar joints and paint. The quality varies by figure and seller. There is no way to know what you will get until you have it in hand. With that in mind, when purchasing these, look for sellers that show pics of the actual figures and not stock official images from the genuine figures. If you can find reviews as well all the better. 
*Note: the boot legs will not be labeled as such. You will know them by their sub $100 USD prices.

Queen's Blade Revoltechs (Figures):
An older line of often anatomically correct figures that still hold up, unfortunately will really only be able to find them opened or used. Prices can range from relatively cheap (Ymir,Nanael,Airi) to expensive (Branwen,Annelotte,Aldora)
*Note: These are older so be on the look out for descriptions that denote that the plasticizer is leaking. The figures themselves are fine but the soft plastic clothes can have this happen
